Unity 3D on Wine
================

This repository contains scripts to make Unity run on Wine the best it can.

**If you are looking for instructions, you can find them [here](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Running_Unity_on_Linux_through_Wine).**

If you want to play Unity Web Player games on Linux, you should look at [Pipelight](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Running_Unity_Web_Player_on_Linux_using_Pipelight).

If you want to give feedback, please do so [here](https://github.com/Unity3D-Wine-Support/Unity3D-on-Wine/issues/48). Thanks!
